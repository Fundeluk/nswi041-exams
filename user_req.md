### User requirements

**Students**
- If an exam is full, I should be able to put myself in a waiting queue that will automatically sign me up for the exam if a spot opens up, because I do not want to check it too often.
- I should be able to view my exam schedule/calendar, because with a lot of enrolled exams, a list view may be disorienting.
- I should be able to filter available exams based on the course they belong to, and whether I have already passed them, because it will be less distracting for me.
**Teacher**
I should be able to kick out enrolled students automatically if they have not yet fulfilled criteria needed for the enrollment (e.g. credit), because it will be tedious to do so manually.
